# Iris Flower Classification

Multi-class supervised machine learning project to predict Iris flower species using sepal and petal measurements.

### Overview
Built an end-to-end classification model on the classic Iris dataset to identify flower species.  
- Explored the dataset with pair plots, scatter visualizations, and species distribution analysis  
- Preprocessed data and split into train/test sets  
- Trained and compared two models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest classifier  
- Evaluated performance with accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix visualization  
- Achieved near-perfect accuracy (~95–100%) across both models, highlighting effective feature use and model selection  

Demonstrates strong understanding of supervised learning fundamentals, algorithm comparison, model evaluation metrics, and interpretable visualization — ideal for entry-level data science and machine learning roles.
