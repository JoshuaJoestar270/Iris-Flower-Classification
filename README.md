# Iris-Flower-Classification
multi-class classification project on the Iris dataset to predict flower species from sepal/petal measurements.
Explored data with pair plots and species distribution.
Trained and compared two models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest.
Evaluated performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix visualization.
Achieved near-perfect accuracy (~95–100%), demonstrating understanding of classification algorithms, model comparison, and evaluation metrics.
Illustrates solid grasp of supervised learning fundamentals and model interpretation.

Tech Stack: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
